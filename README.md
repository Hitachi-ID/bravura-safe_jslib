## Prettier

We recently migrated to using Prettier as code formatter. All previous branches will need to updated to avoid large merge conflicts using the following steps:

1. Check out your local Branch
2. Run `git merge 8b2dfc6cdcb8ff5b604364c2ea6d343473aee7cd`
3. Resolve any merge conflicts, commit.
4. Run `npm run prettier`
5. Commit
6. Run `git merge -Xours 193434461dbd9c48fe5dcbad95693470aec422ac`
7. Push

### Git blame

We also recommend that you configure git to ignore the prettier revision using:

```bash
git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
```
